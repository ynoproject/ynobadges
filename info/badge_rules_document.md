# Badge Rules Document

*** THE RULES OF THIS DOCUMENT WERE LAST UPDATED ON 3/13/2025 @ 10:00 AM PST ***

*** BADGES SUBMITTED PRIOR TO THIS DATE ARE SUBJECTED TO PRIOR RULES DOCUMENTS ***


## What is a Badge?

A Badge is a collectible icon used on YNO. Badges are given to the players for accomplishing various tasks in the different fangames, such as reaching a deep area or finding a fun event.

Badges can be equipped and displayed next to your name when you send a message in chat. Badges can also be arranged into a Badge Gallery, which you can use to show off your favorite Badges.

Badges are meant to be a reward given to the player for achieving something that takes time, effort, skill, or in some cases, RNG.


### Why were the badge rules changed?

Badge rules were changed due to numerous issues that we kept noticing or having reported to us, including but not limited
to:

- Artists monopolizing specific authors (wataru, qxy, Kong)
- Artists claiming badges and not making them
- Badges that are too easy or too hard to obtain
- Badges that are excessive and unnecessary

This list, again, does not include all of the reasons. No particular Artists were the cause of the Badge rule changes.


### What’s this new-fangled Badge Committee?

The Badge Committee was created as a way for regular users to have a say in further Badge development. The terms moderator/Badge Committee are interchangeable in this document, as all moderators are a member of the Badge Committee by default, and Badge Committee members moderate Badge related activity.


### So, what are the new badge rules?

Bimmy, I’m glad you asked. Without further ado, here is the current guidebook for Badge production.

## Badge Reservation Rules
- Badge Artists can only have up to four Badges reserved at once. This reservation count applies to all games.
    - For example, you can have two 2kki Badges and two Yume Nikki badges reserved at once. You cannot have four 2kki and four Yume Nikki.
    - Collaborative and previously reserved Badges count towards this total.
    - There is an additional Badge reservation available for Banned user Badges. [Please refer to the Banned user section for further information.](#banned-users)
- Badge Artists may only reserve up to four Badges per week.
    - New Badges may only be reserved seven days after the current oldest at that time.
        - For Example: If an Artist reserves Badges on 1/13, 1/16, 1/17, and 1/18, the available days for reservation in the following week would be 1/20, 1/23, 1/24, and 1/25.
- Badge Artists may only submit art for up to four Badges per week.
- Do not reserve Badges to hold them for another Artist.
    - All Artist(s) found in violation of this rule will be suspended from Badge production for three months.
    - The second violation will result in a permanent ban from Badge production, as well as consideration for removal of all currently published Badges.
    - For example, if an Artist has four currently reserved Badges and wants to reserve another, DO NOT reserve that Badge for them to ensure it will be available once they have an open slot.
- Badge Artists cannot make more than 20% or three of the total badges a given author currently has that are implemented and obtainable, whichever is larger. Please ensure your reservation is valid by calculating this yourself; or ask a moderator to do it for you. We *will* check before your Badge is added.
    - For example, if qxy content has twenty Badges obtainable, and you have made four of those Badges, you need to wait for other Badges to be implemented.
- Badge reservations will have three months to be completed. If not completed, it will be removed from reservations.
- Badges for new content cannot be reserved for the first 72 hours after release on YNOProject. If content is updated, this rule will re-apply.
    - When an update is released, a Badge Committee member will try to post a timestamp for when Badges can be reserved for that update.
    - Do not start working or discuss reserving Badges until after the 72-hour cooldown is over.
        - It is okay to say: “I’m interested in doing x Badge.”.
        - It is not okay to say: “x Badge is mine. I will reserve it. No one take it.”.
            - Nobody can claim a reservation before it is made available.
            - Please reserve any Badge that is available that you’d like, regardless of what others have said.
    - A 24-hour reservation penalty will be applied to anyone found in violation of this rule.
        - During this penalty, the Artist will not be allowed to reserve Badges.
        - If the infraction would occur during the 72-hour cooldown, the 24-hour penalty would begin as soon as the 72-hour cooldown would end.
- When badges for new content that has finished its 72 hour cooldown are able to be reserved, there is a 24 hour period where multiple people can ask to reserve the same badge.
    - If another person reserves the Badge, all Artists with reservations will be pinged to discuss how to proceed.
        - If there are more than two Artists interested, the Badge will automatically be moved to the [Badge Lotto](#badge-lotto-explanation).
        - If there are only two Artists, the Artists will be brought into a thread to discuss how to proceed.
            - The Artists will be pinged. They have 24 hours to respond to the ping.
                - An Artist may designate a representative to represent them if they are unable to respond in the YNO Discord.
            - The Badge will be moved to the Lotto under the following conditions:
                - Both Artists want the Badge.
                - The discussion does not remain civil.
    - It is recommended that an Artist does not begin work on Badge art until after this 24-hour period.
    - After the 24-hour period, the Badge cannot be reserved or lotto’d unless the reservation expires.
- Collaborative Badges count towards the Author count for * all Artists involved *.
- Collaborative Badges must be reserved with all Artists’ names present.
    - Artists can be added upon moderator approval.
    - Please ask for permission before allowing the additional Artist to work on the Badge.
- Do not reserve a Badge and then leave the art status on “Open”.
    - Badges must have an Artist ready to create art before they can be reserved.
- Badge Artists may not submit Badges or Badge updates for other Artists.
- Please reserve your Badge before beginning work on the art for the Badge.
    - This is to ensure that no one else reserves the Badge while you are producing the art.
- If reserving a Badge that was previously removed or made available for re-reservation, please add 'Replacement of the OLDBADGENAME badge.' to your Badge notes.
- When a Badge reservation expires, it enters a 24-hour cooldown. A notice will be posted in #archeology-center or #badge-proposals, and people have those 24 hours to say they'd like to reserve that Badge. Once the 24 hours expires, the Badge Artist will be determined via spinning a wheel. [Please see the Badge Lotto section for more information](#badge-lotto-explanation).
- A one-week extension may be granted upon request. * Please request your extension no later than two weeks before the reservation would expire, and no earlier than one month before. *


## Badge Art Rules

### Resolution

- The art must be 37x37 pixels.
- If submitted above that resolution, at 74x74 pixels, you must provide an explanation as to why. Acceptance of this explanation is at moderator discretion.


### Quality

- The art must not be blurry.
- The art must be submitted as a .png or .gif (when animated) file.
- Please submit a static .png as well as a .gif when submitting an animated Badge.
- The art must meet a certain standard requirement. This is up to moderator discretion but is commonly understood to be comparing it to other badge art qualities.
- The art must be legible.


### Art Content

- The art must accurately represent the content shown in the game.
- The art must accurately show content that is seen when obtaining the Badge. It cannot show content you encounter after you would obtain the Badge, for example.
- The art cannot depict offensive or inappropriate content. Please ask a moderator if you are unsure about this rule.
- The art must be relevant to the game. It should not include a meme or something from outside of the game. This is subject to case-by-case review. Please contact a Moderator or Badge Committee Member for this review.
- The art cannot plagiarize content. Do not rip sprites directly from a game.


### Animation

- An animation cannot be larger than 2mb, and it cannot be longer than 5000 frames.
- The animation cannot trigger those with light related sensitivities.
- The animation must loop properly.


## Badge Point Guidelines

For each type of Badge we could think of, we have provided a range that the value of the Badge’s BP should fall into. You are welcome to suggest a BP value that fits within these ranges, but the moderators reserve the final say on the BP value awarded to a Badge.

- Visit x World: 10 – 25 bp depending on the depth of the world.
- Visit subarea of a World: 10 – 20 bp depending on how easy it is to access the subarea.
- Events: 15 – 25 bp depending on how easy it is to access the event.
- NPC Reaction: 10 - 15 bp
- Time Trials: 20 – 50 bp depending on how difficult the time trial is.
- Getting Effect, Menu Theme, etc: 10 – 15 bp depending on how difficult the effect is to obtain.
- Kill count, Vending Machine, Minigame, Challenges: 20 – 50 bp
- Endings: 20 – 50 bp depending on how difficult it is to obtain the ending.

## Hidden and Secret Badges

Hidden Badges are completely hidden from the Badge menu.

Secret Badges may have the condition and/or name be secret. The art may also be secret, but that will also make the name and condition secret.



Hidden Badges are classified by the following:
- Equal to or less than 5% chance to encounter per dream
- Upon reasonable developer request. Moderators reserve the final say on whether a Badge can be Hidden.
- Extremely difficult hidden conditions that are not meant to be revealed.
- High scores in skill ceiling minigames (NASU, HOZO)



Secret Badges are classified by the following:
- Endings
- Major Events (Uboa events, FACE, Liar-Kun, Junction Space, Dream Park)
- High difficulty, but not impossible events.


Your Badge will be rejected if you use these conditions incorrectly. If you are unsure, please contact moderation.


## General and Miscellaneous Rules

Your Badge may be rejected if it violates any of the following:
- Artist is banned from YNOProject.
- Area is already full of Badges.
- Developer of content does not want Badges made for their content.
- Badge requires usage of bugs or cheating.
- Badge requirements do not correspond to one another.

Your Badge may be removed if it violates any of the following:
- Artist is banned from YNOProject.
- Developer of content does not want Badges made for their content.

If an Artist requests their Badge is removed:
- The Badge itself will be removed and made available for re-reservation.
- If a member of a collaborative Badge requests the Badge to be removed, their credit will be removed instead.
    - The remaining Artists for that Badge may choose to re-do their Badge art if they wish, or it may be left as-is.


## Badge Condition Rules
- Please try to provide as many accurate internal conditions related to your Badge as possible (switches, variables, map IDS, etc).
- If your Badge is a one-time event, you must have an alternative method of obtaining the Badge. For example, “Memories of the Chromatic Nest”:

![An example of a one-time badge for collecting menu types, which can be obtained by visiting the places where you collected them.](/info/assets/one_time_badge_example.png)

- If the game updates in a way that makes your Badge no longer obtainable, a moderator will contact you and attempt to figure out a solution.


## Badge Redundancy Rules

This section of the rules is heavily up to interpretation. If you can provide a good enough reason as to why your Badge is not redundant, it may still be approved.

- 1 . No “redundancy”. If a Badge is deemed too similar in goal or achievement to another Badge, it will be rejected.

    - a. Example of an area with two badges that are **NOT** redundant:
	
        - i. While these two Badges target the same location, they are both independent of one another and do not trigger simultaneously. In addition, these Badges are given to the player for finding a unique subarea as well as finding the exit to the area.
		- ![Badge for interacting with Aiko in Dream Pool.](/info/assets/redundancy_example_1.png)
		- ![Badge for visiting the Streetlight Thief's lair in Dream Pool.](/info/assets/redundancy_example_2.png)
		
		
    - b. Example of **REDUNDANT** Badges:

        - i. These Badges target the same location, are achieved nearly simultaneously, and walking through an area is not enough to justify receiving a badge. In this case, **Linear Technology Complex** is redundant and would be rejected under the new rules.
		- ![Badge for passing through the nine floors of the Techno Condominium.](/info/assets/redundancy_example_3.png)
		- ![Badge for interacting with the ghost on the fourth floor of the Techno Condominium.](/info/assets/redundancy_example_4.png)

    - c. Example of an area with two badges that are **NOT** redundant:

        - i. These Badges are shown due to the above example.

        - ii. While these Badges target the same area and are achieved nearly simultaneously, they are rewards for performing two separate tasks. As such, they would both be accepted under the new rules.
		- ![Badge for seeing the creatures in shape of eight change their color by using the Boy and Marginal effects on the eight floor of the Techno Condominium.](/info/assets/redundancy_example_5.png)
		- ![Badge for interacting with the ghost on the fourth floor of the Techno Condominium.](/info/assets/redundancy_example_4.png)


## Badge Lotto Explanation

The Badge Lotto is the most fair system we could devise to handle multiple Artists desiring to make the same Badge. While standard reservations are still on a first come, first served basis, Badges that need to be replaced under the following rules below will enter the Badge Lotto.
By following the rules below, you may enter the Badge Lotto. A wheel will be spun with everyone’s entry on it, and the Badge Artist will be decided in this way.

### Badge Lotto Rules

- **Badge Lottos are hosted in the YNO Discord. If you are not a member, you cannot participate in the Badge Lotto.**
- When a Badge is lotto’d away, there will be an announcement posted with a sign-up sheet.
- Do not sign up for a lotto Badge if you are already at maximum current reservations.
    - Maximum current reservations is **four** if the Lotto is not for a banned user.
    - Maximum current reservations is **five** if the Lotto is for a banned user.
- You may sign up for multiple Lottos as long as you have at least **one relevant slot** available in your reservations.
    - If it is not a Banned User Lotto, You cannot sign up if your only available slot is your Banned User slot.
- Do not sign up more than once for a Lotto Badge.
- Do not sign up for somebody else.
    - Do not sign up so you can win the lotto and give the Badge to somebody else.
        - Artists found in violation of this rule will have all of their Badge reservations removed and will be suspended from producing Badges for six months.
- Please sign up for the Badge Lotto with your **Discord Username or User ID Number**.
- A wheel will have every user’s name put onto it, and then spun.
- If an Artist wins the lotto, that Artist cannot drop the Badge or give the Badge to somebody else.
    - The Badge will remain reserved until the Artist’s reservation expires.
    - This is to ensure that no one is winning Badges to hold onto for someone else.
    - There is an exception to this rule:
        - If you win a Lotto, then win another that is above your maximum current reservations, you may choose to drop the Badge you **just won** in the Lotto to keep the new Badge.
            - For example; If you were at 4/4 and 0/1, then entered a Lotto for Badge A, D, and E. You won Badge A, but then also win Badge D, you **can only choose** to give up Badge A, rather than any of your previous reservations (4/4).
- Badges are put up for lotto under the following conditions:
    - Badge Artist is banned from YNOProject.
    - Badge Artist requests their art to be removed.
    - Badge reservation expires.

- The banned Artist’s solo-credited Badges are made available for reservation.
    - These Badges follow the same rules as new content Badges.
        - Please refer to [Badge Reservation Rules](#badge-reservation-rules) for more specifics.
    - If multiple Artists attempt to reserve the same Badge, [please refer to duplicate handling](#badge-reservation-rules).

    - Any art that was done with the now banned user must be re-done.
    - These entries will be set as Reserved on the Badge Sheet under the other Artist(s) credited on the Badge.
        - A new deadline will be set for the Badge, as if it has just been reserved.
        - The new Badge Artist(s) will be informed of this change.
    - New Artist(s) may be included to help create the new art for the Badge.
